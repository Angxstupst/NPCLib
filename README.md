# NPCLib 1.7.10 (1.7 R4)

A lot of changes were made to the protocol after the 1.8 update. After bug reports, I decided to isolate this part of NPCLib so it could not longer cause the issues developers were having.

Updates to (and releases of) this part of NPCLib can be recognized by the `-legacy` suffix.
